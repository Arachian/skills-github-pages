## Holding Myself Accountable

I'm starting this so that I can hold myself accountable in continuously learning about various topics within cyber security. For that matter, it doesn't necessarily have to be cyber security related. I just want to continuously learn so that I can level-up in my career. For example, I gave a talk last year at Shell On The Border 2023 which is a local hacker conference held in Fort Smith, Arkansas. My talk was on the history of hacking with a focus on phreaking. I learned a lot during my research for that talk so I could have posted about it here. I will try to do that with anything I learn, whether it be a productivity application I'm learning or working my way through a new certification. Anyway, if you have stuck around this long then I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to read my posts. Happy hacking!
